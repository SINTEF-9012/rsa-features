   <description url="[Enter Feature URL here.]">
      The ATHENA SOA methodology feature contains online help documenting
the ATHENA baseline methodology for SOA. The feature has been
developed as an extension for Rational Software Modeler (RSM).

The development of the SOA methodology feature is partly funded
by the European Commission through the ATHENA integrated project
(IST-507849). The work does not represent the view of the European
Commission or the ATHENA consortium and the developers are solely
responsible for the feature&apos;s content.
