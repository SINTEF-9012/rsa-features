      UML Profile for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).
The UML profile for EJB defines a set of extensions to UML that can be used to model software implemented with EJB in UML. These extensions will let enterprise tool and framework vendors provide EJB modeling capabilities using UML, as well as forward and reverse engineering between UML models and EJB implementations.
