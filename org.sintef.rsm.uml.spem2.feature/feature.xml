      UML Profile for Software &amp; Systems Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) Version 2.
Defines a set of UML 2 stereotypes that allows presenting SPEM 2.0 methods and processes using the UML 2. However, the definition of these stereotypes in this specification only covers their presentation, but relies on the SPEM 2.0 metamodel for all semantic definitions and constraints. In other words, this version of the profile does not contain any OCL constraints, but relies on the SPEM 2.0 metamodel semantics to define all of its constraints.
